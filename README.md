# React A11y Test

A React-based Single Page Application (SPA) built with the GOV.UK Design System to demonstrate accessibility and performance best practices.

## 🎯 Purpose

This proof of concept explores how accessible and performant a React SPA can be when built with the GOV.UK Design System components. It serves as a testing ground for:

- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, screen reader support, keyboard navigation
- **Performance**: Bundle optimization, lazy loading, memoization, virtual scrolling
- **Developer Experience**: TypeScript, modern tooling, component reusability

## 🚀 Features

### Accessibility
- ✅ WCAG 2.1 AA compliant components
- ✅ Screen reader optimized
- ✅ Full keyboard navigation support
- ✅ Focus management and ARIA labels
- ✅ High contrast and color accessibility
- ✅ Semantic HTML structure

### Performance
- ⚡ Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- ⚡ Code splitting and lazy loading
- ⚡ React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback optimizations
- ⚡ Virtual scrolling for large datasets
- ⚡ Bundle analysis and optimization
- ⚡ Real-time performance metrics with Web Vitals

### Components
- 📝 Comprehensive form examples with validation
- 🎨 GOV.UK Design System component gallery
- 📊 Performance testing and metrics
- 🧭 Accessible navigation and routing

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for build tooling
- **GOV.UK Frontend v5.11.2** for design system
- **MoJ Frontend v5.1.5** for Ministry of Justice components
- **React Router** for navigation
- **React Hook Form** with Zod validation
- **Web Vitals** for performance monitoring
- **Playwright** for accessibility testing
